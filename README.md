# pay_share

My first repository on GitHub. I'm using it as a version control tool for my
project, pay_share.

pay_share is an idea I had for an app to help with automating and tracking
group purchases and evenly distributing them amongst friends. The goal of this
project is to first build the framework and do initial testing / verification
on the concept. Later down the road, I hope to incorporate this code into an
iphone/android app.

I'm using gcc 4.8 on a Ubuntu VM with glibc 2.19.

To get started, pull this repository and cd into the top directory, pay_share.

Build code:
make

clean code:
make clean

Thats it!
